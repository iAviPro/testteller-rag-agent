   #### Error Scenario Details (if applicable)
   - **Error Condition:** [Description of the error being tested]
   - **Recovery/Expected Behavior:** [How the system should handle the error and recover]

2. Integration Test Cases:
   Focus: Component integration (FE-BE, service-to-service, event-driven) and contract validation.
   Documentation Requirements:
   - Can be generated from Product and/or Technical docs, but Technical docs/code are required for precision.
   Template:
   ### Test Case INT_[Number]
   **Integration:** [Source Component] -> [Target Component]
   **Type:** [FE-BE/API/Event]
   **Category:** [Contract/Flow/Error]

   #### Test Scenario
   - **Given:** [Prerequisite state, e.g., "Service B is ready to publish events"]
   - **When:** [The action, e.g., "A valid `UserCreated` message is sent to the topic"]
   - **Then:** [The expected outcome, e.g., "Service A consumes the message and creates a new user record"]

   #### Request/Message Payload
   ```json
   {{
     "//": "Example of a valid/invalid payload for this test case",
     "userId": "user-abc-123",
     "email": "test@example.com"
   }}
   ```

   - **Target State Change:** [e.g., A new row exists in the `users` table in Service A's database]
   - **Headers/Metadata:** [e.g., `Content-Type` is `application/json`]

   #### Error Scenario Details (if applicable)
   - **Fault:** [e.g., "Malformed JSON payload", "Network timeout between services"]
   - **Expected Handling:** [e.g., "Message is sent to Dead Letter Queue", "Source service retries 3 times"]

3. Technical Test Cases:
   Focus: System limitations, infrastructure, and technical edge cases (e.g., rate limiting, concurrency, deadlocks, recovery, timeouts, performance, security).
   Documentation Requirements:
   - Higher weightage on Technical Documentation and Code. If missing, the result's precision will be lower.
   Template:
   ### Test Case TECH_[Number]
   **Technical Area:** [Performance/Security/Resilience]
   **Focus:** [e.g., Rate Limiting, Deadlock, Retry Policy]

   #### Objective
   [e.g., "To determine the maximum throughput of the `orders` service before latency exceeds 500ms."]

   #### Test Hypothesis
   [e.g., "The system will gracefully handle traffic up to 1000 requests/sec by returning 429 Too Many Requests without crashing."]

   #### Test Setup
   - **Target Component(s):** [List of services/infrastructure under test]
   - **Tooling:** [e.g., k6, JMeter, chaos-mesh]
   - **Monitoring:** [e.g., Prometheus, Grafana dashboards to watch]
   - **Load Profile/Attack Vector:** [Description of the load pattern or security threat]

   #### Execution Steps
   1. **Establish Baseline:** [Run a low-load test to get baseline metrics.]
   2. **Inject Load/Fault:** [Gradually increase load or inject the fault, e.g., "Increase concurrent users by 10 every 30 seconds."]
   3. **Monitor System:** [Observe key metrics during the test.]
   4. **Halt Condition:** [When to stop the test, e.g., "When p99 latency > 1s or error rate > 5%."]

   #### Success Criteria (Assertions)
   - **Performance:** [e.g., p99 latency < 500ms, CPU utilization < 80%]
   - **Error Rate:** [e.g., Must be less than 1%]
   - **System Behavior:** [e.g., System recovers within 5 minutes after load is removed. No data corruption occurs.]
   - **Security:** [e.g., The SQL injection attempt is blocked and logged.]

   #### Failure Analysis
   - **Expected Failure Mode:** [e.g., "Service scales up pods", "Requests get throttled with 429"]
   - **Unexpected Failure Mode:** [e.g., "Service crashes", "Data gets corrupted"]

4. Mocked System Tests:
   Focus: Isolated component testing with mocked dependencies.
   Documentation Requirements:
   - Requires Technical Documentation or Code to be effective.
   Template:
   ### Test Case MOCK_[Service]_[Number]
   **Component Under Test:** [Service Name/Version]
   **Type:** [Functional/Error/State]

   #### Objective
   [e.g., "Verify the `calculate-shipping` function correctly handles zip codes from mocked external `geolocation-service`."]

   #### Setup & Mocks
   - **System Under Test (SUT):** [The specific function/API endpoint being tested, e.g., `POST /shipping/calculate`]
   - **Mocked Dependencies:**
     - **Service:** `geolocation-service` | **Endpoint:** `GET /zip-info` | **Returns:** `{{"state": "CA", "is_remote": false}}`
     - **Service:** `db-connector` | **Function:** `save_calculation` | **Expected Call:** `with arguments(...)`
   - **Initial Data State:** [e.g., "The `products` table contains product with ID `prod-xyz`"]

   #### Trigger
   - **Action:** [e.g., "An HTTP POST request is made to the SUT's endpoint"]
   - **Input/Payload:**
     ```json
     {{
       "productId": "prod-xyz",
       "zipCode": "90210"
     }}
     ```

   #### Assertions & Verifications
   - **Return Value/Response:** [e.g., "The function should return `10.99`" or "The API should respond with 200 OK and body `{{\"price\": 10.99}}`"]
   - **Mock Interactions:**
     - **`geolocation-service`:** Was called exactly 1 time with `zipCode=90210`.
     - **`db-connector`:** Was called exactly 1 time with the correct calculation result.
   - **State Changes:** [e.g., "No changes to the database are expected."]

COVERAGE DISTRIBUTION:
Ensure a balanced and modern test distribution that prioritizes resilience and robustness.

1. Test Type Distribution (Test Pyramid):
   - **Mocked System Tests (30%):** The foundation of the pyramid. These fast, isolated tests provide the highest ROI for catching component-level bugs.
   - **Technical Tests (25%):** A large portion dedicated to non-functional requirements like performance, security, and resilience, ensuring the system is robust.
   - **Integration Tests (25%):** Fewer tests that focus on the contracts and interactions between services.
   - **End-to-End Tests (20%):** Used sparingly to verify complete, critical user journeys from start to finish.

2. Scenario & Coverage Distribution (for each test type):
   - **Negative, Corner & Edge Cases (40%):** The majority of tests should focus on how the system behaves under stress, with invalid data, and at its operational limits. This is key to building a resilient application.
   - **Happy Path Scenarios (30%):** A substantial set of tests to ensure the primary, expected functionality works correctly.
   - **Failure & Recovery Scenarios (15%):** Focused tests that simulate dependencies failing to verify that recovery mechanisms (retries, circuit breakers) work as intended.
   - **Non-Functional Scenarios (15%):** Specific tests dedicated to validating security vulnerabilities and performance SLAs.

DOCUMENTATION IMPACT & RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. For E2E Tests:
   - With Product Docs Only: Limited to user flows.
   - With Technical Docs: Enhanced with technical validation points.
   - With Code: Precise component interaction validation.
   - Recommendation: "For enhanced technical validation of E2E tests, consider adding: [missing technical docs/code]."

2. For Integration Tests:
   - With API/Event Docs: Contract-based testing is possible.
   - With Technical Design Docs: Enhanced flow validation.
   - With Code: Precise contract and implementation validation.
   - Recommendation: "For complete contract and integration coverage, consider adding: [missing technical docs/code]."

3. For Technical Tests:

   - With Code: Precise edge case and implementation-specific validation.
   - Without Technical Docs/Code: Limited to generic scenarios.
   - Recommendation: "For deep technical and edge case coverage, ingesting [Technical Design Docs/Code] is highly recommended."

4. For Mocked Tests:
   - Required: Technical Docs or Code.
   - Without Either: Cannot be generated effectively.
   - Recommendation: "Mocked System Tests require technical documentation (e.g., API Contracts, Design Docs) or direct code access to be generated."
